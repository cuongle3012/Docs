Learning Plan - Design Implementation
Introduction
This learning plan outlines the technical areas I aim to strengthen to further develop my skills in ASIC Design Implementation, with a focus on synthesis, timing, physical design, verification, and automation scripting.
Synthesis
- Run full block-level synthesis independently
- Understand and apply optimization strategies
- Perform comprehensive synthesis checklist review (QoR, DRC, warnings)
- Improve analysis skills for timing, area, and power reports
Static Timing Analysis (STA)
- Run sign‑off level STA and evaluate timing closure
- Deepen understanding of timing arc modeling and violation analysis
- Learn and write complete timing constraints (SDC)
- Debug setup, hold, and clock path violations across corners
Place & Route (P&R)
- Execute P&R flow including placement, CTS, and routing
- Investigate optimization strategies for congestion, timing, power
- Analyze reports: utilization, routing, IR drop, DRC
- Learn advanced physical design techniques and sign‑off preparation
Logic Equivalence Check (LEC)
- Gain deeper understanding of LEC flow and methodologies
- Investigate LEC mismatch cases and debugging path
- Document root cause and best practices to avoid common issues
Scripting & Automation
- Improve scripting skills (TCL/Python/Shell)
- Write automation scripts to:
  • generate and apply timing constraints
  • summarize and format reports automatically
  • assist debugging and flow enhancements
- Build reusable internal scripts/toolkits
Conclusion
This plan will guide my next phase of growth toward becoming a strong VLSI design implementation engineer, capable of owning block‑level flow, debugging complex timing and equivalence issues, and contributing automation solutions.
