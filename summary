Internship Report - Design Implementation at Ampere
Introduction
During my internship at Ampere as a Design Implementation intern, I learned the professional workflow and methodologies in ASIC design, focusing on Synthesis, Static Timing Analysis (STA), Synopsys Design Constraints (SDC), Place & Route (P&R), and Logic Equivalence Check (LEC). The experience enhanced my practical knowledge of digital IC design and strengthened my understanding of industry-standard tool flows.
Synthesis
I learned the synthesis flow used in the company, including understanding tool setup, reading design RTL, and generating gate-level netlist. Key topics:
- Company synthesis flow and environment setup
- Inputs: RTL, SDC, technology library, constraints
- Outputs: gate-level netlist, log files, synthesis reports
- Stages: elaboration, mapping, optimization, timing closure
- Ability to analyze timing, power, area reports
- Checklist before and after synthesis (warnings, violations, QoR review)
Static Timing Analysis (STA)
I learned the definition and workflow of STA, which verifies timing for all paths. Key learning points:
- Inputs: gate-level netlist, SDC constraints, libraries, parasitics (post-P&R)
- Outputs: timing reports, slack information, annotated netlist
- Debugging setup and hold violations
- Wrote scripts to summarize and filter timing reports
- Understood multi-corner, multi-mode (MCMM) concepts
SDC (Synopsys Design Constraints)
I studied SDC commands and learned how constraints affect synthesis and STA.
- Clock definitions (create_clock, create_generated_clock)
- Input/output delays, false paths, multicycle paths
- Analyzed constraint impact through reports and timing feedback
Place & Route (P&R)
I learned about the P&R flow and tools used to physically implement the design.
- Inputs: synthesized netlist, floorplan, constraints, tech files
- Outputs: layout, DEF, GDSII, parasitics (SPEF/SDF), reports
- Stages: floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, signoff
- Analyzed utilization, congestion, timing, and DRC/LVS reports
Logic Equivalence Check (LEC)
I performed LEC to ensure functional equivalence between RTL and synthesized netlist.
- Definition: verifies no functional change between two representations
- Ran LEC checks, debug mismatches, and followed checklist for signoff
Conclusion
This internship gave me strong hands‑on experience with ASIC design flows and EDA tools. I improved technical skills in synthesis, STA, SDC, P&R, and LEC while understanding real‑world design methodologies. The experience prepared me for a professional career in VLSI design implementation.
